Today marks the beginning of hopefully many different development blog posts about
developing my own rendering/game engine using Vulkan as the graphics API.

## Personal Goals
- Learn more about Computer Graphics in general.
- Get familiar with designing complex software.
- Use multi-threading effectively

## Project Goals
- Make a game engine tailored for real-time Grand Strategy games.
- Create debug tools for said engine.

## Ambitious Goals
- Be able to create a simple Grand Strategy game.
- Make it easy to modify or completely change said game. A good example would be games made by Paradox Interactive.
